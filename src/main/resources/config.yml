    # Info:
    # Valid latitude range: -90 to 90
    # Valid longitude range: -180 to 180
    # 1 degree of latitude and longitude is about 111 km
    # The defaults here assume 1 block = ~1 km

    # What to do if player exceeds the range specified above
    # 1 - do nothing (clamp to nearest allowed value)
    # 2 - wrap the number
    # for example; if the calculated player's latitude is 94 degrees (bad), it'll be converted to -86 degrees (good)
